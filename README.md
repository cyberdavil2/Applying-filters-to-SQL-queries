# Applying-filters-to-SQL-queries


 

<h2>Description</h2>
In this project, I created a portfolio document to exhibit my expertise in utilizing Linux commands for managing file permissions, aiming to enrich my cybersecurity portfolio for potential employers or recruiters. The document encompasses a project description outlining the objective, followed by screenshots or typed commands with detailed explanations, ensuring clarity in understanding command functionality. Additionally, it includes a summary section to highlight key insights gained from the experience. Specific requirements, such as detailing the use of chmod to update permissions, utilizing ls -la to check permissions, interpreting the 10-character string representing permissions, and understanding hidden files and directories, were met to provide a comprehensive overview of Linux command proficiency for file permission management. Through this project, I've demonstrated practical skills in securing sensitive data and managing access controls within a Linux environment.
